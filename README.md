# ResidencePlus

This is a fork of Folium-MC/Residence-Maven and it is mainly used for its translation from Ant to Maven, however this fork includes custom features for a public server.

# Residence

Residence is different from most protection plugins in that it aims for the users to be able to protect their own homes without having to bother the admin to do it. 

Residence has support for a variety of different protection types including preventing movement through areas, all of which can be configured by the land owner, and limited by the admin.
